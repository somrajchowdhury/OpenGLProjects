# OpenGLProjects

> All the projects uploaded are tested and compiled on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (MVS2010).
>
> **NOTE :** The Microsoft Visual Studio software series are all Upward Compatible. Upward Compatible means if you have a project which was saved and compiled in MVS 2010, and then you are tyring to run this project on any other computer which has an earlier version of MVS installed `(example, MVS2008)` then, this project won't work. On the other hand, if the system has any higher version of MVS installed `(example, MVS2013, MVS2015 or MVS2017)` then, there'll be no problem in running the project.
>
> **NOTE :** If you have the source code of the project pasted on any text editor, then no matter which version of MVS you use you can always `Create New Project` and proceed further.
>
> Here, i have uploaded the source code in `.txt` format, so that you can easily run this on any version.
