> All the projects uploaded are tested and compiled on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (MVS2010).
>
> **NOTE :** The Microsoft Visual Studio software series are all Upward Compatible. Upward Compatible means if you have a project which was saved and compiled in MVS 2010, and then you are tyring to run this project on any other computer which has an earlier version of MVS installed `(example, MVS2008)` then, this project won't work. On the other hand, if the system has any higher version of MVS installed `(example, MVS2013, MVS2015 or MVS2017)` then, there'll be no problem in running the project.

> Here, i have uploaded the source code in `.txt` format, so that you can easily run this on any version.

**PUZZLE :**

- The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have n disks of different sizes and three pegs.

- The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on the first peg, the smallest at the top, thus making a       conical shape.

- The goal is to move all the disks to the third peg, using the second one as an auxiliary. 

**RULES :**

o In order to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, the following rules are to be obeyed:

- Only one disk may be moved at a time.

- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the pegs and sliding it onto another peg, on top of the other disks that may     already be present on that peg.

- No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
